   - Qualitative and quantitive approach in literary studies: Can machine learning models classify poetic texts written in Polish language? Can machine learning modles capture the dependencies observed by literary scholars?

2. Tools: transformers architecture - herBERT model
3. Steps:
   - data preparing: tokenization, embedding
   - calculating Euclidean and cosine distances
   - dimensionality reduction
